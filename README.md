### What I learned

I have learned the best practice in approach any design using HTML semantics and working with flexbox

```html
<section>Some HTML code I'm proud of</section>
<article> With this one</article>

```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: hsl(31, 77%, 52%)
  color: hsl(184, 100%, 22%)
  color: hsl(179, 100%, 13%)
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.



### Continued development

I will give more indepth study to flexbox, grid and animations
